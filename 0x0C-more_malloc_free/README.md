C - More Malloc Free ðŸ“ƒ 0x0C-more_malloc_free
About this project:
In this project i learnt and practiced;

How to use the exit function
What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them
Tasks file description;
main.h: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in this project

0-malloc_checked.c: C function that returns a pointer to a newly-allocated space in memory using malloc.

If malloc fails, the function causes normal process termination with a status value of 98.
1-string_nconcat.c: C function that returns a pointer to a newly-allocated space in memory containing the concatenation of two strings.

The returned pointer contains s1 followed by the first n bytes of s2, null-terminated.
If n is greater than or equal to the length of s2, the entire string s2 is used.
If NULL is passed, the function treats the parameter as an empty string.
If the function fails - returns NULL.
2-calloc.c: C function that returns a pointer to a newly-allocated space in memory for an array, using malloc.

Allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each.
The memory is set to zero.
If nmemb = 0, size = 0, or the function fail - returns NULL.
3-array_range.c: C function that returns a pointer to a newly-allocated space in memory containing an array of integers.

The array contains all the values from parameters min to max, inclusive, ordered from min to max.
If min > max or the function fails - returns NULL.
